Tenant Setup – WillowMora
Date Completed: 10/01/2025
Tools Used: Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Portal

Lab Objective
Create a dedicated Microsoft Entra ID tenant to simulate an enterprise identity environment for hands-on IAM and cloud security practice.

What I Did
Created a Microsoft 365 Business tenant using the fictional company name WillowMora
Logged into the Azure Portal and switched context to the WillowMora tenant
Verified Global Administrator privileges to ensure full access to identity and security configurations

Security / Cloud Concepts Applied
Microsoft Entra ID tenant architecture

Identity tenant isolation
Privileged role verification (Global Administrator)
IAM foundational setup

Outcome
Successfully established a standalone tenant representing an enterprise cloud environment
Confirmed administrative access required for configuring users, groups, applications, and security controls in later labs

Why This Matters
A dedicated Entra ID tenant is the foundation of any cloud identity environment. This setup mirrors how organizations establish isolated identity boundaries and assign privileged roles to manage users, access, and security policies.
