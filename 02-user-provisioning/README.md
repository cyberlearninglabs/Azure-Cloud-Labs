# Lab 02 – User Provisioning & Application Access

## Objective
Simulate onboarding a new employee and granting controlled access to enterprise applications in Microsoft Entra ID.

---

## Part 1: User Provisioning – Zora Stone

### What I Did
- Created a new user named **Zora Stone** in the WillowMora Entra ID tenant
- Assigned a temporary password and enforced password reset on first sign-in
- Verified user properties and account status

### Why This Matters
User provisioning is a core IAM responsibility. It ensures employees receive identities that can later be secured with MFA, Conditional Access, and lifecycle policies.

---

## Part 2: Application Assignment

### What I Did
- Navigated to **Enterprise Applications**
- Selected **Microsoft Entra SAML Toolkit**
- Assigned Zora Stone to the application
- Verified assignment visibility

### Why This Matters
Application access is identity-driven. Assigning users (or groups) controls who can authenticate to enterprise systems and supports least privilege access.

## Outcome
Successfully simulated employee onboarding and application access using Microsoft Entra ID, mirroring real-world IAM workflows.
