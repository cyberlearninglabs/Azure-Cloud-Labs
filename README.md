# Azure-Cloud-Labs
This repository documents my hands-on experience building and securing environments in Microsoft Azure. These labs demonstrate real-world skills in cloud administration, identity and access management, networking, security monitoring, and troubleshooting.
Each lab includes step-by-step configurations, screenshots, and lessons learned to reflect practical experience relevant to IAM Analyst, Azure AD Administrator, and Cloud Security Analyst roles.
